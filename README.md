# BurstForLogitech
Simple applet to simulate wave/ripple on perkey RGB Logitech keyboards

This is a stripped-off version of [jwrpalmer99's Logitech Vent Monitor](https://github.com/jwrpalmer99/LogitechVentMonitor).

Removed Ventrilo controls and just retained the RGB wave effect, updated SDK and dll to current release version from Logitech.

Improved the UI a little.
